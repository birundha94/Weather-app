🚀 Just Created: My Weather Report Generator! 🌦 🚀

Check out this cool project where I built a weather report generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time data from a weather API to give you up-to-the-minute weather info! ☀️🌧️

💻 Key Features:

1.Clean and responsive UI

2.Real-time weather updates based on your location 🌍

3.Integrated with a weather API for live data 🌡️

It was a fun challenge connecting the front-end with the server-side using API calls. Definitely improved my skills in web development and API handling! 💪
